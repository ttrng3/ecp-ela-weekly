"""Compare two copies of a dashboard's data and say which one is authoritative.

GitHub Pages and the claude.ai artifact each hold their own copy of `data/`,
because an artifact cannot fetch across origins. Two copies can drift. This
says whether they have, and which way to sync.

Handles all three dashboard schemas: OMNI keys its weeks `history[].week` with
an ISO `generated`; ECOPM keys them `wk[].id` with a display `generated` plus an
ISO `generatedUtc`; ECP x ELA carries only a `weeks` manifest, with each week's
content in its own file. The comparison is the same either way.

Usage:
    python3 tools/reconcile.py <dir-a> <dir-b>

Each directory is a `data/` tree. Exits 0 when they agree, 1 when they differ.
